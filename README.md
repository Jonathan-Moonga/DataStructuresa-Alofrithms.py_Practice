Python and DSA Practice

This repository is my personal hub for practicing Python programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It’s a collection of everything I’m learning — from solving LeetCode problems to tackling CodePath technical interview prep challenges, class assignments, and my own coding explorations.

The main goal is to track my progress, improve problem-solving skills, and build a solid foundation for technical interviews and real-world applications.

📂 Contents
LeetCode Solutions – step-by-step problem-solving with explanations and clean code.
CodePath Challenges – technical interview prep exercises.
Class Assignments – coursework and related problem sets.
Personal Learning – random explorations, practice snippets, and experiments.
🚀 Why This Repo?
To document my journey learning Python & DSA.
To have a structured place for practice and review.
To prepare for coding interviews and future engineering projects.
To share my learnings with others who might find them useful.
